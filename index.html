        - Indent tags appropriately according to nesting depth

        Linked Data Capabilities (<code>ld-ocap</code> for short) provide a
        secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority
        utilizing the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">
          object capability model</a>.
        Capabilities are represented as linked data objects which are signed with
        <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/">
          Linked Data Signatures</a>.
        Linked Data Capabilities support delegating authority to other entities
        on the network by chaining together capability documents.
        "Caveats" may be attached to capability documents which may be used to
        restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions
        which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may
        be later revoked.

        This document does not cover a specific method for delivering
        Linked Data Capabilities to an object, though something like
        the inbox property and associated delivery mechanisms from
        Linked Data Notifications and ActivityPub is one possible
        system.
        However there is nothing about Linked Data Capabilities that is
        specific to HTTP; for example, both capabilities and invocations
        could be stored on a blockchain or a distributed hash table.

        <h2>Linked Data Capabilities by Example</h2>
        <p>
          Much of modern computing security infrastructure relies on "who is
          doing something" using access control lists.
          For example, our friend Alyssa P. Hacker has a car, and she would
          like to drive it.
          In the access control list world, the car itself may scan Alyssa's
          face, determine that Alyssa is the driver, and say "Welcome Alyssa,
          you are now free to drive."
          Talking cars are appealing and fun, but Alyssa may run into
          challenges when she would like to allow others to drive her car.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, there is another paradigm that is even more familiar to
          the car scenario, but less familiar in the context of computing,
          despite providing some superior properties and a greater degree
          of safety: object capabilities.
          Object capabilities focus not on "who" is peforming an action, but
          upon "what" source of authority permits an action to occur.
          As it turns out, Alyssa does not have a talking and face-scanning
          car, she has a car that accepts a car key.
          The car may have no memory of Alyssa whatsoever, but as long as
          Alyssa holds the kind of key that enables her to drive the car, she
          can drive the car.
          Capabilities are very similar to this car metaphor, and we can encode
          this same idea in Linked Data Capabilities:
        </p>

        <!-- TODO: Should we include the full embedded key?  That's better
             practice in general (outside of DIDs) but will make the example

        <p>
          Alyssa lives with her roommate and long-time friend Ben Bitdiddle.
          While they're living together, she'd like that he be able to drive
          her car too.
          Capabilities support delegation, so she could delegate a new
          capability to Ben giving him full authority, not unlike going to the
          hardware store and having them copy the car key.
          But Alyssa knows that she and Ben will probably not be roommates
          forever, and she feels no need for him to be able to drive her car
          once they are not, so she would like to have the option to revoke
          his authority.
          In the world of object capabilities, this is entirely possible by
          adding a "caveat" that permits future revocation.
          We can imagine this to be like a new car key that has a remote
          destruction mechanism: Alyssa can press a button that she has,
          a wire burns out inside the car key, and the car key will not be usable
          anymore.
          Alyssa generates a new capability document that points at the
          capability she has, adding the caveat:

        <p>
          Alyssa hands the car key to Ben, and Ben marks the car key in such
          a way that reminds him that it's specifically to drive Alyssa's car.
          Several months pass and Ben receives a message from Alyssa asking if
          he might enjoy joining her at an award ceremony her university is
          holding.
          Alyssa is already at the university and is getting a ride to the
          venue, so she suggests Ben drive her car and meet her there.
          Ben invokes his capability, the car performs all relevant checks on
          the capability (including that the proof/signature is valid and applicable,
          and that the caveat is still valid), and off Ben drives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ben arrives at the fancy award venue, where there is valet parking.
          The Valet approaches wearing the nametag "Lem E. Driveit" and asks
          for a key to park the car.
          Ben remembers he has heard some stories about valets going on
          joyrides and isn't sure if they're true, but decides there's no need
          to take the risk: he can use his capability to forge a new, further
          restricted capability which he can delegate to Lem.
          This new car key has the caveat that it can be used to drive up
          to 5 kilometers, but no more:

        // so this is only 5 km more than the current value

        <p>
          (It probably doesn't matter to this scenario, but since it is derived
          from the car key that Ben holds, it also has the same caveat that it
          will also be remote destructed by Alyssa along with Ben's car key
          should she press the relevant button.)

        <!--
           - Alyssa has a car: ocap edition

           - Alyssa wants to let her roommate/friend Ben drive, she delegates a
             capability to him.  Alyssa trusts Ben, but decides it's her car, so
             she wants the ability to change her mind if for example they are no
             longer roommates, so she adds a caveat that says that Ben can drive
             the car unless Alyssa revokes that permission

           - Ben drives to an event with valet parking.  Lem E. Driveit, the
             valet, asks for Ben's key so that he may park the car, but Ben
             decides that it would be most responsible for him to make sure that
             Lem can't take Alyssa's car for a joyride, so when delegating a
             capability to drive Alyssa's car, he adds an additional caveat:
             this valet-key capability can only be driven for five kilometers,
             which is long enough to park a car with some buffer, but short
             enough to not permit Lem to take a joy ride.

           - Alyssa has a car: ACL edition

           - The ability to delegate and add caveats are wonderful features.
             However, they aren't the only reason to choose Capabilities over ACLs...

        <h2>Capabilities Are Safer</h2>
        <p>
          We can see from the above example that by using an object capability
          system such as Linked Data Capabilities can give us some additional
          power around delegating and restricting the scope of capabilities.
          But object capabilities provide improved safety characteristics
          over Access Control Lists which may make them frequently better
          choices (for more details, see the paper
          <a href="http://waterken.sourceforge.net/aclsdont/current.pdf">
            ACLs Don't</a>).
          Object capability systems are in general more robust against:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Ambient authority problems:</b>
            For example, in an access control list environment,
            if an attacker gets you to open a message in your email client
            which contains an image which triggers an arbitrary code execution
            vulnerability in the image library it is using, an attacker can
            use this to do everything that you can: read or destroy your
            documents, they can run programs as you, and they can in general
            do anything that you can... all from a pin-prick sized vulnerability.
            Properly using an object capability environment, the worst an
            attacker could do is mess with your email (or if the program is
            itself capability aware, they may not be able to do even
            that... they could just display some nasty imagery on your screen,
            which they could do already anyway).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Confused deputy attacks:</b>
            For example, browsers and both backend and frontend software for
            the web have frequently struggled with Cross-Site Request Forgery
            attack issues.
            Your browser may both allow you websites to access resources on
            other websites and also allow you to log into various websites,
            say a social networking site or a bank.
            A malicious website could use this to its advantage to trick
            your browser into performing actions as you on those other sites...
            say to read from or spam to your social timeline, or to withdraw
            money from your bank account.
            While various techniques to can be used to restrict the scope
            of these attacks, they are notoriously hard to prevent.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Object capabilities are less vulnerable to these kinds of attacks
          because capabilities are an encoding of "the principle of least
          authority" in software development practice.
          Linked Data Capabilities helps bring the power of capabilities
          to the web, providing specific and directed grants of authority.

          Why don't all child capabilities require a authenticationMaterial property?
          The reason is that it is perfectly reasonable for an entity which has
          authority to a capability to give an attenuated capability to
          <em>itself</em> to be used in a specific context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capabilities are not structured around "who has access" to something
          but rather holding onto a capability for a particular use, and in
          order to avoid confused deputy and ambient authority problems,
          in general objects should not hold on to a "bucket" of capabilities
          which grant them authority, but hold on to them within specific
          contexts for specific purposes.
          In general, when an object is granted a capability, it is important
          that it know for what specific purpose it has been granted that
          capability so that it does not become confused and use it in the
          wrong scenario.
          This is not unlike how in computer programs a procedure called with
          specific arguments understands for what the meaning of those arguments
          are and for what they may be used.

        An invocation SHOULD have an <code>id</code> (which may also serve as a

        <p>
          Since invocations are themselves linked data documents, it is
          possible for an invocation to refer to an invocation as an argument.
          For this reason it is critical that mechanisms for accepting
          invocations be sure which invocation is being performed.
          For example, a mechanism that accepts linked data capabilities as
          JSON-LD documents will likely have no trouble telling which
          invocation is being performed since that will be the "top"
          of the framed document.
          However, a mechanism which accepted N-Quads would need additional
          information supplied perhaps in the headers in order to be able
          to determine the "root" of the invocation.

          Actions are a common way to direct behavior of an invocation.
          Targets are free to choose their own mechanisms for directing
          behavior, but MAY support the <code>action</code> property on
          invocations as one common bahavioral direction technique.
          The <code>action</code> property points to a URI as a form of
          vocabulary to determine which action is being performed.
          For example, a capability to a file storage system may allow
          for both reading and writing files, and a user could choose
          to set the <code>action</code> to
          <code>https://datastore.example/WriteFile</code>
          as an argument on their invocation.

      <h2>Relationship to Verifiable Credentials</h2>

      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">
          Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>
        provides a powerful vocabulary for correlating information and
        presenting correlated information in a secure way.
        This can be used to make claims about some subject, to present
        credential certifying you are qualified to do some thing, or so on.
        This is useful for gathering and presenting information that can
        be reasoned about.
        Indeed, this maps nicely to "the real world", as humans tend to be
        "correlation/reasoning machines".
        For example, Eva Lu Ator is hoping to hire a system administrator and
        may check for a college diploma, past work history, or recommendations
        from known entities considered qualified to judge competency to fulfill
        the role, and all of these can be modeled nicely with the Verifiable
        Credentials Data Model.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus it may be tempting to design a system in which a credential
        is presented in order to permit or forbid access to some resource.
        Unfortunately, associating "who is authorized to do what" leads us back
        to all the problems of access control lists,
        <a href="capabilities-are-safer">which we would like to avoid</a>.
        When returning to our hiring a system administrator example it is
        easy to imagine how, upon hiring Alice as as a system administrator,
        Eva would hand Alice a capability to begin administrating her systems.
        But in considering the previous step where Eva contemplates
        <i>whether or not to hand Alice that capability</i>
        seems to pull us right back to correlating information about Alice's
        identity.
        (What is Alice's educational background?  What is Alice's prior work
        experience?)
      </p>

      <p>
        We seem to be in a conundrum.
        Claims and credentials are forms of correlation that allow us to reason
        about an entity in our squishy human world, but are unsafe when used as
        mechanisms to authorize some event to occur within a system.
        Capabilities are a safe mechanism to model the flow of authority through
        a system, but there are times when capabilities have not been granted
        and we need to make a "judgement call" by correlating information about
        that entity.
        What should we do?
      </p>

      <p>
        To pose the question is to see the answer: the right approach is to use
        each system for what it does best.
        Use correlation (Verifiable Credentials) in a reasoning system (most
        commonly human reasoning) as a path to make judgements about whether to
        hand an entity a specific set of initial capabilities.
        Use capabilities (Linked Data Capabilities) as the mechanism to grant
        and exercise authority through computing systems.
        To return to our system adminstrator example, when Alice applies for the
        job, she submits a series of credentials about her prior work history
        and degree, and Eva is able to verify that it is Alice's former
        employers and university which have made these claims.
        Deciding that Alice is fit for the job, Eva hands Alice her initial
        capability which grants her authority to administrate the systems in
        question (with a caveat that allows Eva to revoke that authority at a
        future date, if appropriate).
        Alice uses that capability as the initial entry point into
        administrating the system.

    <section class="appendix informative" id="handling-abuse">
      <h2>Handling abuse</h2>

      <p>
        The previous section discussed cases in which correlation (particularly
        through Verifiable Credentials) is used to grant an initial set of
        capabilities.
        This section discusses how correlation may be used to revoke
        capabilities under certain circumstances, and steps that should be
        taken to ensure this is done safely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capability systems focus on what authority grants that an operation may
        be performed, not on who is performing the action.
        In some object capability systems (such as many object capability
        programming languages) it is not even possible to see what entity is
        invoking a capability.
        In the case of Linked Data Capabilities, it is always possible to
        inspect an invocation to check which authentication material authorized
        to invoke the capability is being used in the invocation, and this may
        permit checking a certain amount of "who" is performing the action,
        but to focus on the "who" rather than the source of authority would
        <a href="capabilities-are-safer">
          bring us back to the dangers of Access Control Lists</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nonetheless, there comes a time when correlating information about
        usage of a resource becomes critical, and this is in migigating abuse.
        Even traditional capability systems, in developing solutions to this
        problem, develop techniques for correlating information about "who"
        has performed an action.
        (For example,
        <a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/horton/">Horton</a>
        is one such system for E, though as previously stated,
        such information can be cleaned already by looking at the invocation
        and capability chain documents in Linked Data Capabilities.)
        The key to permit detecting and mitigating abuse safely in a capability
        based environment is to treat correlation of who is using a service
        not as something that is used per-invocation, but as something to be
        reasoned about to possibly revoke authority.
        (Astute readers may observe that between the previous section and this
        section we have defined safe ways to use correlation in conjunction
        with capabilities: as the entry point and possible termination point,
        with capabilities powering the machine in-between.)
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, Alice has granted capabilities (with caveats that permit
        revocation) to a number of users access to run programs on the systems
        she is administrating, but someone is using their capability to abuse
        the system.
        The system itself permforms the invocations as the users call them,
        but Alice, or a program Alice runs, is able to analyze a log of past
        invocations called.
        Having finished the analysis, Alice realizes that the abuse is coming
        from the invocation of a capability granted to some of Mallet's
        authentication material, and Alyssa revokes that capability.
